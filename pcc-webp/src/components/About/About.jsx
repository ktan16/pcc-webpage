        Founded in 1978, Pacific Cordage Corporation (PCC) has been dedicated to
        producing ropes that combine strength, durability, and craftsmanship. We
        specialize in working with abaca fibers, the strongest natural fiber in
        the world, and blend them into custom solutions designed to meet the
        exact needs of our clients. Every rope is made with precision: sourced
        from trusted suppliers, blended from multiple fiber classes, and tested
        to ensure consistent performance. This commitment allows us to provide
        ropes that are not only strong and slip-resistant, but also reliable
        across industries ranging from shipping and marine use to furniture
        production and film sets. For over four decades, PCC has stood for
        quality and trustâ€”offering rope solutions that honor tradition while
        meeting the demands of modern applications.
